# üß¨ DNA Hidden Repeats Detection Algorithm and Isochore Research
---

## üß† Overview

This repository is part of a capstone research project focused on designing a novel algorithm for **DNA segmentation** and the **detection of hidden repeats**.  
The goal is to identify biologically relevant genomic regions‚Äîespecially **isochores** and **hidden repetitive sequences**‚Äîby applying statistical models that separate **signal** from **noise**.

**üìå Project Title:**  
**_A new generation of DNA hidden repeats detection algorithm and its application for isochore research_**

## üîç Background & Motivation

**Isochores** are long, compositionally homogeneous DNA regions with relatively constant GC content. They play key roles in genome organization, gene regulation, and chromosomal structure.

However, a possible underlying cause of isochores‚Äî**hidden DNA repeats**‚Äîis not well understood or easily detected using traditional methods.

This project addresses the challenge by:

- Segmenting DNA sequences into fixed-length windows.
- Detecting **dominant k-mer patterns** using frequency analysis.
- Quantifying **statistical significance** using P-values and a segment scoring strategy.
- Applying **Fisher's method** to combine multiple P-values for more robust signal detection.
- Iteratively **merging segments** based on shared features and noise thresholds.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology Overview
### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Initial Segmentation**  
   ‚Üí Divide DNA into fixed-size segments (e.g., 12 bp).

2. **k-mer Frequency Analysis**  
   ‚Üí Count all k-mers (default k=3) in each segment.

3. **Dominant k-mer Identification**  
   ‚Üí Identify the most frequent k-mer within each segment.

4. **Statistical Significance Testing**  
   ‚Üí Evaluate how likely the dominant k-mer pattern is due to chance using:
   - **P-values**: Calculated from a binomial model based on expected vs. observed k-mer frequencies.
   - **Fisher‚Äôs Method**: Combine multiple P-values (from the occurrence matrix) to produce a single test statistic.
   - **Chi-squared Distribution**: Used to convert Fisher‚Äôs statistic into a combined P-value, enabling interpretation of overall segment significance.

5. **Segment Merging**  
   ‚Üí Merge adjacent segments with the same dominant k-mer.  
   ‚Üí Account for noisy or weak segments using conditional logic during merging.

6. **Final Classification**  
   ‚Üí Classify segments as **strong** (signal) or **weak** (noise) based on:
   - The combined Fisher P-value,
   - Segment score,
   - And the overall structure and continuity of patterns.

## üöÄ Research Plan

### üî¨ Objectives

- Map **hidden repeats** within isochores using DNA sequences.
- Use reference data from genomic databases.
- Analyze genomes from multiple species (e.g., monkey, dog).
- Compare hidden repeat maps with known isochore structures to assess correlation.

### üõ†Ô∏è Planned Steps

1. **Construct Hidden Repeat Maps**
   - Generate repeat-based segmentations for each genome.
   - Represent each map as a data structure for comparison.

2. **Use Genomic Databases**
   - Source DNA sequences from public genome repositories.

3. **Analyze Multiple Species**
   - Perform segmentation on dozens of genomes across different species.
   - Focus on evolutionary comparison between organisms.

4. **Compare Maps Across Species**
   - Measure similarity between hidden repeat maps using metrics such as:
     - **Jaccard Index**
     - **Cosine Similarity**
   - Evaluate how well the structure of repeats aligns with isochore organization.

5. **Fragmentation Comparison**
   - Analyze and compare segmentations (fragment boundaries) between species.
   - Use existing segmentation comparison algorithms to assist with structural comparison.

*These steps will help test the hypothesis that hidden repeats influence or align with isochore structure across evolutionary scales.*
